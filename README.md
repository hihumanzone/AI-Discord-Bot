## API KEY PROVIDERS:
- Groq: https://console.groq.com/keys
- Together AI: https://api.together.xyz/settings/api-keys

All of them have a free plan and work without a credit card. They don't have a lifetime usage limit, except for `Together AI`, but it provides $25 in credits, which will probably last a long time because they are cheap. All of them, except for `Kraken AI`, appear to have good rate limits. For `Kraken AI`, we get 500 credits per day, which equates to about 25 `Claude 3.5 Sonnet` messages per day.
